# tidySpectR

The aim of this package is to provide tidy methods for the 
analysis of spectral dataset in order to improve 
accessibility and reproducibility of chemometric analysis.
No more 'Analysis was performed using a collection of 
undocumented MATLAB scripts available upon request'.

This package is meant to fill the gap between data acquisition 
and preprocessing (phasing, baseline correction) and modelling
with the tidymodels metapackage.

It will implement methods to plot, bin, crop, mask and normalize 
spectra, as well as chemometric specific modelling methods such
as pareto or VAST scaling.

Contributions are very welcome!
