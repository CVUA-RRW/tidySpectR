\title{Applies VAST scaling on numeric data}
\usage{
step_vast(
  recipe,
  ...,
  scaling = "autoscale",
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  means = NULL,
  sds = NULL,
  cvs = NULL,
  na_rm = TRUE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("vast")
)

\method{tidy}{step_vast}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variables are affected by the step. See \code{\link[=selections]{selections()}}
for more details. For the \code{tidy} method, these are not
currently used.}

\item{scaling}{Either \code{autoscale} or \code{pareto}. Controls the scaling method.
See notes below.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{means}{A named numeric vector of means. This
is \code{NULL} until computed by \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}}.}

\item{sds}{A named numeric vector of stadard deviations. This
is \code{NULL} until computed by \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}}.}

\item{cvs}{A named numeric vector of variation coeficients. This
is \code{NULL} until computed by \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}}.}

\item{na_rm}{A logical value indicating whether \code{NA}
values should be removed when computing the standard deviation and mean.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[=bake.recipe]{bake.recipe()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}

\item{x}{A \code{step_vast} object.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
\code{tidy} method, a tibble with columns \code{terms} (the
selectors or variables selected), \code{value} (the
standard deviations and means), and \code{statistic} for the type of value.
}
\description{
\code{step_vast} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe
step that will perform VAST scaling on the columns
}
\details{
Variable Stability (VAST) scaling preforms centering and scaling followed
by a weighting of each variable by its variation coeficient.

The argument \code{scaling} controls which scaling method should be used before
variable weighting. \code{autoscale} will perform mean-centering and standard deviation
scaling while \code{pareto} will scale by the square-root of the standard deviation.
